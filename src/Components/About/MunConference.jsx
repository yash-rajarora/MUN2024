                    Focusing on the need to value ideas and approach toward solutions for the atrocities around the globe, some like-minded
                    individuals figured a need for such a platform for people to discuss and deliberate With the laying of the foundation 
                    by Shri Kulbhushan Kothari, our journey began in 2012, with us being the first institution in Jaipur and second in 
                    Rajasthan to introduce Model UN to the crowd. Commemorating the 12 years of legacy, we stand firm as the host of 
                    exceptional MUN conferences in the state. With the collective efforts of our enthusiastic and extensive organizing 
                    committees over the years, we have arisen as one of the best and most promising Model UN societies in India.
